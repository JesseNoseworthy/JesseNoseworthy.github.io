# Getting Started

WORK IN PROGRESS

### System Requirements

- Node.js >= 6.9.x
- Yarn Package Manager

### Getting Started

1. Clone this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JesseNoseworthy/react_portfolio). 

2. Ensure you have [Yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/instal) first, then install all of the package dependencies for the project from your terminal:

```
yarn
```

3. Start the local development server:

```
yarn start
```

### Yarn Cheatsheet

For a quick guide on some of the differences between `yarn` and `npm`, check out [this guide](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/#toc-cli-commands-comparison). But in short, here's a quick reference:

| NPM                       | Yarn                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| npm install               |  yarn || yarn install |
| npm install jquery --save | yarn add jquery       |
| npm run start             | yarn start            |
| npm run build             | yarn build            |

##### A few notes:
- You can run `yarn` or `yarn install` and get the same result
- With Yarn, packages are saved to the `package.json` automatically. That's awesome, right?
